    <p>The Beacon Ordering App is aimed at making implemnting beacons into a food / beverage business more appealing
    to business owners. It achieves this by adding functionality that can help them become more productive and
    effiecnt in serving their customers.</p>

    <p>While you are in a reastraunt or cafe with beacons installed the app will know you are inside the store
        and allow you to request service, or make your order. Your order will be sent to the kitchen where it will
        prepared. Using the beacons and your phone, the app will be able to determine which table made the order
        meaning the staff will know who ordered the drink or meal.
    </p>
    <p>Other features include being able to browse the menu, and being notified what the soup of the day etc are. As
        well as any deals the business has on while you are there. Businesses will also be able to incorporate loyalty
        programs into the app as well that encourage repeat business and use of the app.</p>

    <p>The above Youtube video from Kontakt.io explains the different beacon deployment options a business can take.
        The first option is to install a grid based system which requires more beacons and takes longer to set up, for this
        reason I believe it is unlikely that businesses will be as likely to adopt this beacon layout. The second option
        is a point based system, that instead uses how far away you are from the beacon to approximated location.</p>

        <p>Due to the larger set up cost and set up time invoved in the grid based system, I believe that the point
            based system has a much better chance of being adopted. This means unfortunately a super accurate table based
            order system couldn't be a required feature. However an easy solution would be to number each table and the
            customer would simply have to say which table they were ordering for.

<div class="How_it_works">
    <h1><a name="linkto_how_it_works">HOW IT WORKS</a></h1>
    <img class="api" src="api.png"></img>
    <p>Using the API provided by Kontact.io it will be possible to develop a mobile app that can
    communicate with the beacons. The beacon will send out a message letting the app know what store you are currently in,
    then after connecting to a server you will be able to view the menu and place an order or request to be served. The
    will have the business version of the App which will recieve the request or order, and will know who order based on
    the location of the phone which made the request if they use a grid based system, which may not be desirable to some
    business owners.</p>

    <p>The beacon could also be set up to relay other messages to devices with the app installed, such as the options for
        the soup or fish of the day for example, or any other special deals the business has put on. </p>

<div class="Benefits">
    <h1><a name="linkto_benefits"></a>BENEFITS</h1>
    <p>This app will benefit the businesses who adopt it as it means during peak times, customers wont have to wait to
        order another drink, and as a result may end up buying more. If not at the very least it will reduce customer 
        annoyance as they wont be left waiting to be served. Also taking orders through the app will spped up the process
        of getting the order back to the kitchen. It will also give potential informationa and statitics to the business 
        owner or manager about the demographics of their customers, what they order and how much they pay in total, on 
        average.</p>

        <p>Collecting information like this can make it easier for the business to then create better deals or promotions 
            to attract new customers, and increase repeat customers. It can also provide further insite into what meals are
            the most popular at certain times and with which customers, and potentially could makes suggestions to customers,
            based on their previous behaviour meals that suit their taste.
